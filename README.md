# Sweep Squared
 A unibody version of the Ferris Sweep split keyboard.
 
## Why?
The only reason I gave up on using the original Sweep is being able to comfortably use it on top of the laptop keyboard. Hopefully this one will work better.

## But it's just Zaphod
Yes.

## Firmware
Will do soon, when free time :|

Both QMK and ZMK should be fairly trivial to make.
