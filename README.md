# Sweep Squared
 A unibody version of the Ferris Sweep split keyboard.
 
## Why?
The only reason I gave up on using the original Sweep is being able to comfortably use it on top of the laptop keyboard. Hopefully this one will work better.
upd 06/21/2022: it does actually feel better!

## But it's just Zaphod
Yes.
